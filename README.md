# Complex Linear Algebra cmplxalg
A complex linear algebra package written in golang.

Implements many common linear algebra algorithms for complex-valued matrices and vectors.

This package implements the types Matrix and Vector, both of which are arrays of complex numbers. It can utilize these types to perform many different operations such as examining if two vectors are parallell, finding the angle between them, and calculating the inverse of a matrix. All of this with fully-fledged support for complex numbers.
